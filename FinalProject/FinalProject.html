        <h2>More About Me</h2>
        <p>I really like football, NFL, not college. The Green Bay Packers are my favorite team. They ha
            ve a wide variety of offensive weapons. I am kind of addicted to drafting teams on Madden 15
            . My dad bought me a XBOX One for my birthday and he also bought me Madden 17 to go with it.
            I hope I can draft teams on Madden 17 too.
        </p>
        <p>I also really like country music. Garth Brooks is probably my favorite artist. Devil Went Down to Georgia might be my favorite song.</p>

            <p>I lived in a split-level with a small backyard. I miss the fun games we kids used to play in the basement.</p>
